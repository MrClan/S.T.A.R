This project shows how you can create cool looking yet 'Scientifically Correct Orbital Simulations' for any satellite you want
using Blender and Python.


Orbit Prediction for any Earth-orbiting object is done using the Classical/Keplerian Orbital Elements. The orbital elements 
associated with an Earth-orbiting object generally comprise of six elements which describes the shape, size and orientation 
of its orbit. 

A generalized data format known as the <b>Two Line Element (TLE)</b> Set is used to keep track of the orbital elements of 
individual satellites and are used by Organizations to keep track of the satellites and debris in space.
